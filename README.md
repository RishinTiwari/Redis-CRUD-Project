Redis E-commerce CRUD Project

Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic E-commerce CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) system using Redis, a powerful in-memory
data store. It focuses on managing order data efficiently for an online store.
Features:
- Data Storage: Utilizes Redis to store order details as key-value pairs,
providing fast and efficient data retrieval.
- Python Script: Includes a Python script for loading order data from CSV
files into Redis, demonstrating the process of populating the database.
- CRUD Operations: Illustrates how to perform CRUD operations on order
data using both Python and Redis CLI, showcasing the flexibility and
simplicity of Redis.
- Business Scenario: Aligns the project with a fictional E-commerce business
scenario, making it relatable and applicable.
How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the provided Python script to load sample order data into your Redis
instance.
3. Explore and execute CRUD operations using the Python script or Redis
CLI.
Requirements:
- Redis installed and running locally or on a specified host.
- Python environment for running the provided script.
